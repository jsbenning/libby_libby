    <h1>Welcome to LibbyLibby!<small> LibbyLibby is a simple site for listing and trading books.  Simply add some books, complete your shipping info, and browse the site to find books you like.  If you like a book, suggest a trade; others can then trade for a book from your list or reject the trade.  If you both agree to trade, ship the selected title to the other person in a timely fashion via USPS media mail --- usually $3-5 --- and they'll do the same for you (unless they're bad neighbors!). And if things don't work out --- the book doesn't come, or it's in awful condition, for example --- you can rate the shipper!<br />Happy reading, happy trading!</small></h1>
